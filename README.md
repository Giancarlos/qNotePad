qNotePad
========

Basic "Notepad" like application coded in C++/Qt, tested on Windows and Linux
(Ubuntu). Developed using Qt Creator, for educational purposes. Made out of
my desire for simpler applications, and to have software that is Cross Platform,
however, I'm no longer attempting to continue this project. I'm hoping
to rebuilt this project in Python in the future, or another programming language.
